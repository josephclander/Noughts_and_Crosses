# Noughts and Crosses

An iterative process of the game "Noughts and Crosses" a.k.a. "Tic Tac Toe"

## My intention

The inital commit is a base level working game from which we'll look at the efficiency of the code, the styling and how to implement extra features.

### FUTURE FEATURES

***

* restart game **DONE**
* add points to players scores **DONE**
* highlight winning line **DONE**
* change who starts **DONE**
* enter names
* message states who wins **DONE**

### POTENTIAL REFACTORS

***

* can you make the currentboard added to after each turn? **DONE**
* the brute force count stops if a cell is empty **DONE**
* only need to start checking after 5 turns **DONE**
* game stops after the winner has been announced **DONE**
* if no blanks on a winning combo but not a win, can it be ignored from future win checks?
* Edge case of more than one winning line
